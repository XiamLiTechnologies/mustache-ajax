Plugin for Mustache that automatically loads required templates via ajax.

## Installation

Just add one of the following scripts to your website (and also [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js) obviously):

#### Not minified
```html
<script src="https://cdn.xiamli.com/mustache-ajax-1.1.0.js" integrity="sha384-zJbfM01a/E65lSRze+E52Kz3xZS3aJxZL16VcM2t+e+UHNlN4IqL5Zc+TqubqpE/" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

#### Minified
```html
<script src="https://cdn.xiamli.com/mustache-ajax-1.1.0.min.js" integrity="sha384-mFMlxhMZno3UApG/mV5UzloZ4AruUjJpL7UWWrr+wbSYd1pGbRjsFhPFjmfkxkno" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

## Usage
After adding the script to your website you're ready to go.
Example use:

```html
<div id="someDiv">
  <p>Hello there!</p>
</h2>
```

templates/aTemplate.mustache:
```mustache
<p>Welcome back {{ name }}!</p>
```

javascript:
```javascript
MustacheAjax.html('someDiv', 'aTemplate', {name: 'Dorian'})
```

</h2>
```
